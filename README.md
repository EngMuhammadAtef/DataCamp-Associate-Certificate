# MY Work

## Task 5
The business wants to predict whether members will attend using the data provided.

The type of machine learning that this is **classification** problem.

The attended column is nominal. whether the member attended the class (1) or not (0).

## Task 8

We used logistic regression because it is a type of regression analysis that is used to predict **the probability** of a binary outcome (such as attended \ not attended) based on one or more input variables1. It uses a logistic function to transform the odds of the outcome into a value between 0 and 1

We used random forest because it is a machine learning method that uses **multiple decision trees** to make predictions. We use random forest because it can **improve the accuracy** and **reduce overfitting** compared to a single decision tree.


## Task 10
### Explaining which model performs better and why

**Random forest model is better than logistic regression**

Random forest model and logistic regression are two different methods for classification problems. Random forest model uses an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions, while logistic regression uses a logistic function to estimate the probability of each class.

Some advantages of random forest model over logistic regression are:

- It can handle missing values, outliers, and non-linear relationships.
- It can classify data into more than two categories with just one model.
- It can capture complex interactions among features.

Some disadvantages of random forest model compared to logistic regression are:

- It requires more computational resources and time to train and test.
- It is less interpretable and explainable than logistic regression.
- It may overfit the data if the number of trees is too large or the depth is too high.
